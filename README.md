# Crimes Against Women in India – Interactive Dashboard

## Overview  
This project visualizes and analyzes 20+ years (2001–2021) of crime data against women in India using an interactive dashboard. The aim is to simplify complex multivariate datasets into accessible visual insights for policy research, media communication, and public awareness.

**Objective**: To reduce cognitive load and uncover patterns, trends, and state-wise disparities in gender-based violence using visual storytelling.

## Dataset  
- **Source**: National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), via Kaggle  
- **Scope**: Covers over 48 lakh total cases, including rape, dowry deaths, domestic violence, kidnapping, and trafficking.  
- **Granularity**: District-wise across 35 states/UTs, over 21 years.  
- Dataset Link: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

## KPIs Created  
1. **Total Crime Cases vs. Crime Type**  
   Highlights the proportion and severity of rape among overall crimes.  
2. **State-wise Contribution to Crime Type**  
   Identifies high-burden regions (e.g., Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh) through treemap and choropleth visualizations.

## Visualizations Used  
- **Choropleth Map** – Visualizes total rape cases by state  
- **Line Chart** – Trends of different crimes across years  
- **Gantt Chart** – State-wise timeline view of case surges  
- **Box Plot** – Distribution spread to reveal outliers  
- **Treemap** – State-wise contribution to national rape counts  

Each visualization was selected based on task abstraction and visual idioms (e.g., color hue, spatial position, shape, and intensity) to enhance perception and interpretability.

## Insights Uncovered  
- **Temporal Surges**: Notable spikes post-2012 Nirbhaya case reforms  
- **State Hotspots**: Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan emerged as high-risk zones  
- **Uneven Distribution**: Some states show extreme outliers in dowry deaths  
- **Lack of Correlation**: Certain crimes do not rise uniformly across states  

## Tools Used  
- Tableau for dashboard creation  
- Excel / Pandas for preprocessing and data cleaning  

## Conclusion  
The dashboard bridges the gap between raw statistics and stakeholder understanding by transforming cognitive-heavy crime data into perceptual narratives. It equips users to make informed, region-specific interventions for women’s safety.
